# Airline Ticket System

## What is ATS?
The Airline Ticket System is a C# project developed to help Airlines companies to manage their business flow with the clients. By having a Graphical Interface, it will make the interaction with the application easier for the client by making it easier to book a new flight, cancel a flight, or even view the status of their current flight! As for the staff, they will be able to create new filghts, assign tickets to clients, or change their seats if they do not like it.
